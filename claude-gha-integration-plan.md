**Tech Stack**: React Router v7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, AWS serverless backend  
**Existing CI/CD**: Comprehensive deployment workflow with linting, testing, and AWS deployment  
**Repository Structure**: Workspaces for frontend, backend, and infrastructure

## Integration Approaches

### Approach 1: Claude Code GitHub App (Recommended)
**Complexity**: Low  
**Maintenance**: Minimal  
**Features**: Rich

Claude Code is Anthropic's official GitHub application that provides native integration with minimal setup.

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Install Claude GitHub App**
   - Visit the Claude GitHub App marketplace page
   - Install on the repository with required permissions:
     - Contents: Read
     - Issues: Read/Write  
     - Pull requests: Read/Write
     - Actions: Read

2. **Configure Authentication**
   ```yaml
   # Add to repository secrets
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: <your-anthropic-api-key>
   CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN: <oauth-token>
   CLAUDE_REFRESH_TOKEN: <refresh-token>
   CLAUDE_EXPIRES_AT: <expiration-timestamp>
   ```

3. **Create Workflow File**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/claude-review.yml
   name: Claude PR Review
   
   on:
     pull_request:
       types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
     issue_comment:
       types: [created]
     pull_request_review_comment:
       types: [created]
   
   jobs:
     claude-review:
       if: |
         (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude')) ||
         (github.event_name == 'pull_request_review_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude')) ||
         (github.event_name == 'pull_request')
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         contents: read
         pull-requests: write
         issues: write
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             fetch-depth: 0
   
         - name: Run Claude Review
           uses: grll/claude-code-action@beta
           with:
             use_oauth: true
             claude_access_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
             claude_refresh_token: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_REFRESH_TOKEN }}
             claude_expires_at: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_EXPIRES_AT }}
             timeout_minutes: "30"
   ```

     issue_comment:
       types: [created]
   
   jobs:
     claude-review:
       if: |
         github.event_name == 'pull_request' || 
         (github.event_name == 'issue_comment' && contains(github.event.comment.body, '/review'))
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       permissions:
         contents: read
         pull-requests: write
         issues: write
       steps:
         - name: Checkout repository
           uses: actions/checkout@v4
           with:
             fetch-depth: 0
   
         - name: Get PR changes
           id: pr-changes
           run: |
             if [ "${{ github.event_name }}" = "pull_request" ]; then
               git diff origin/${{ github.base_ref }}...HEAD > pr_diff.txt
             else
               PR_NUMBER=$(jq -r .issue.number "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH")
               gh pr diff $PR_NUMBER > pr_diff.txt
             fi
           env:
             GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
   
         - name: Run Claude Review
           uses: ./.github/actions/claude-review

       const githubToken = core.getInput('github_token');
       const model = core.getInput('model');
       const reviewStyle = core.getInput('review_style');
   
       const anthropic = new Anthropic({
         apiKey: anthropicApiKey,
       });
   
       const octokit = github.getOctokit(githubToken);
       const context = github.context;
   
       // Get PR diff
       const diff = await getDiff(octokit, context);
       
       // Generate review using Claude
       const review = await generateReview(anthropic, diff, model, reviewStyle);
       
       // Post review as comment
       await postReview(octokit, context, review);
       
     } catch (error) {
       core.setFailed(error.message);
     }
   }
   
   async function generateReview(anthropic, diff, model, style) {
     const prompt = createReviewPrompt(diff, style);
     
     const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
       model: model,
       max_tokens: 4000,
       messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }]
     });
     
     return response.content[0].text;
   }
   
   function createReviewPrompt(diff, style) {
     const styleInstructions = {
       'concise': 'Provide brief, actionable feedback',
       'detailed': 'Provide comprehensive analysis with examples',
       'security-focused': 'Focus primarily on security vulnerabilities and best practices'
     };

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
```yaml
# Required secrets (add via GitHub repository settings)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: # Anthropic API key with appropriate limits
GITHUB_TOKEN: # GitHub token with PR and issue permissions
```

### Permission Configuration
```yaml
# Minimal required permissions
permissions:
  contents: read        # Read repository contents
  pull-requests: write  # Comment on PRs
  issues: write        # Comment on issues
```

### Rate Limiting
- Implement request throttling
- Monitor API usage costs
- Set appropriate timeout values
- Cache responses where possible

## Cost Management

### Token Optimization
- Limit diff size sent to Claude (e.g., max 50KB)
- Use file filtering to exclude generated files
- Implement smart chunking for large PRs
- Cache similar review patterns

### Usage Monitoring
```yaml
# Add cost tracking to workflow
- name: Track API Usage
  run: |
    echo "Tokens used: ${{ steps.claude-review.outputs.tokens_used }}"
    echo "Estimated cost: ${{ steps.claude-review.outputs.estimated_cost }}"
```

## Integration with Existing Workflow

### Update Current Deployment Workflow
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # ... existing steps ...
      
      # Add Claude review as optional step
      - name: AI Code Review (if requested)
        if: contains(github.event.pull_request.body, '@claude') || contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'ai-review')
        uses: ./.github/workflows/claude-review.yml
```

### Project-Specific Configuration
Create `.claude/settings.toml` for project-specific instructions:
```toml
[review]
focus_areas = ["security", "performance", "accessibility"]
file_patterns = ["frontend/**/*.tsx", "backend/**/*.ts", "infra/**/*.ts"]
excluded_patterns = ["**/*.test.ts", "**/node_modules/**", "**/dist/**"]

[prompts]
context = """
