# PWA MediaSession Conflict Solution

## Issue Description

When multiple PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) are installed on iOS and both handle media playback, iOS can get confused about which app should respond to media controls on the lock screen. This results in the wrong PWA being launched when tapping the iOS native media player controls.

## Root Cause Analysis

The problem occurs because:

1. **Multiple PWAs competing for MediaSession control**: When multiple PWAs set up MediaSession handlers, iOS doesn't have a clear way to determine which app should handle media controls.

2. **Poor MediaSession lifecycle management**: The original implementation didn't properly clean up MediaSession handlers when the component unmounted or when playback stopped.

3. **Missing PWA manifest media capabilities**: The PWA manifest didn't properly declare media handling capabilities to help iOS understand this is a media-focused app.

4. **Lack of app identification**: Without proper PWA identification, iOS couldn't distinguish between different media PWAs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed MediaSession API Implementation

**File: `frontend/src/components/FloatingMediaPlayer.tsx`**

Key improvements:
- **Proper cleanup**: Added cleanup effect that removes all MediaSession handlers when component unmounts
- **Better state management**: Separated MediaSession setup from playback state updates
- **Enhanced metadata**: Added fallback artwork and proper album name with "Rewind" branding
- **Position state tracking**: Added `setPositionState` for better scrubbing support
- **Handler optimization**: Set up handlers only once and reuse them

```typescript
// Cleanup MediaSession when component unmounts
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if ('mediaSession' in navigator) {
      // Clear all handlers when component unmounts
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('play', null)
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('pause', null)
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('seekbackward', null)
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('seekforward', null)
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('previoustrack', null)
      navigator.mediaSession.setActionHandler('nexttrack', null)
      navigator.mediaSession.metadata = null
      navigator.mediaSession.playbackState = 'none'
    }
  }
}, [])
```

### 2. Enhanced PWA Manifest

**File: `frontend/vite.config.ts`**

Added media-specific PWA capabilities:
- **Unique app ID**: `'rewind-podcast-app'` for proper identification
- **Media categories**: `['entertainment', 'music', 'podcasts']`
- **File handlers**: Support for audio file types
- **Protocol handlers**: Custom `web+rewind` protocol
- **Launch handler**: `focus-existing` to prevent multiple instances

```typescript
manifest: {
  name: 'Rewind - Rediscover Podcasts',
  short_name: 'Rewind',
  id: 'rewind-podcast-app',
  categories: ['entertainment', 'music', 'podcasts'],
  file_handlers: [
    {
      action: '/',
      accept: {
        'audio/*': ['.mp3', '.m4a', '.ogg', '.wav'],
      },
    },
  ],
  launch_handler: {
    client_mode: 'focus-existing',
  },
}
```

### 3. Created MediaSession Service

**File: `frontend/src/services/mediaSessionService.ts`**

A centralized service to manage MediaSession state:
- **Singleton pattern**: Ensures only one MediaSession instance
- **Proper lifecycle management**: Initialize, update, and release methods
- **State tracking**: Keeps track of active sessions
- **Conflict prevention**: Properly claims and releases media session control

## How This Fixes the Issue

1. **Clear app identification**: iOS can now distinguish Rewind from other PWAs using the unique app ID and media categories.

2. **Proper session cleanup**: When Rewind stops playing or the app is closed, it properly releases the MediaSession, allowing other apps to take control.

3. **Better metadata**: The enhanced metadata with proper branding helps iOS associate the media controls with the correct app.

4. **Media-focused manifest**: The PWA manifest now clearly declares this as a media application, giving it priority for media controls.

## Additional Recommendations

### For Immediate Testing

1. **Clear browser cache**: After deploying these changes, clear Safari cache to ensure the new PWA manifest is loaded.

2. **Reinstall PWA**: Remove the current PWA from your home screen and reinstall it to get the updated manifest.

3. **Test isolation**: Temporarily remove other media PWAs to verify Rewind works correctly alone, then add them back.

### For Long-term Improvements

1. **Add media session logging**: Consider adding console logs to track when MediaSession is claimed/released for debugging.

2. **Implement playlist support**: Add `previoustrack` and `nexttrack` handlers when you implement playlist functionality.

3. **Add notification integration**: Consider integrating with iOS notifications for better media control visibility.

### iOS-Specific Considerations

1. **Safari limitations**: iOS Safari has some limitations with PWA MediaSession that desktop browsers don't have.

2. **Background limitations**: iOS may suspend PWAs more aggressively, so consider using background sync for playback position.

3. **Lock screen artwork**: iOS may cache artwork, so ensure artwork URLs are unique when episodes change.

## Testing Steps

1. Deploy the updated code
2. Clear Safari cache and website data for your PWA
3. Remove the current PWA from home screen
4. Reinstall the PWA from Safari
5. Test media controls on lock screen
6. Verify it now opens Rewind instead of other PWAs

## Expected Behavior

After implementing these changes:
- Lock screen media controls should consistently open Rewind when active
- Other PWAs should not interfere with Rewind's media session
- Better integration with iOS media system overall
- Proper cleanup prevents lingering media sessions

The key insight is that iOS needs clear signals about which PWA should handle media controls, and proper lifecycle management ensures no conflicts occur between different PWAs.
