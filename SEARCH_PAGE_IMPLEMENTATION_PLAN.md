## Technical Implementation Details

### Search Service Interface

```typescript
interface SearchQuery {
  query: string
  limit?: number
  offset?: number
  podcastId?: string
  sortBy?: 'relevance' | 'date' | 'duration'
  dateRange?: { start: string; end: string }
}

interface SearchResult {
  episode: Episode
  podcast: { podcastId: string; title: string; imageUrl: string }
  relevance: {
    score: number
    matchedFields: string[]
    highlights: Record<string, string>
  }
}

interface SearchResponse {
  results: SearchResult[]
  total: number
  hasMore: boolean
  searchTime: number
}
```

### Search Page State Management

```typescript
interface SearchPageState {
  query: string
  results: SearchResult[]
  loading: boolean
  error: string | null
  filters: SearchFilters
  pagination: {
    offset: number
    limit: number
    total: number
    hasMore: boolean
  }
}
```

### Backend API Integration

**Endpoint**: `GET /search`
**Query Parameters**:
- `q`: Search query (required)
- `limit`: Results per page (default: 20)
- `offset`: Pagination offset (default: 0)
- `podcastId`: Filter by podcast (optional)

## Priority Implementation Order

### Immediate (Phase 1) - 30 minutes
1. **SearchService.ts**: Create frontend search service
2. **Search.tsx**: Implement basic search functionality
3. **Integration Testing**: Ensure API calls work correctly

### Short-term (Phase 2) - 45 minutes
4. **Enhanced UI**: Better search results display
5. **Search Controls**: Filters and sorting
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error states

### Medium-term (Phase 3) - 30 minutes
7. **Advanced Features**: Search history, keyboard shortcuts
8. **Performance**: Caching and optimization
9. **Analytics**: Search usage tracking

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Search input accepts queries
- [x] Search results display correctly
- [x] Search API integration works
- [x] Loading states implemented
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Pagination works correctly

### Performance Requirements
- [x] Search debouncing (300ms)
- [x] API response time < 2 seconds
- [x] Results render quickly
- [x] No memory leaks with frequent searches

### User Experience Requirements
- [x] Clear search states (empty, loading, error, results)
- [x] Search result highlighting (via backend)
- [x] Keyboard navigation support
- [x] Mobile-responsive design
- [x] Accessibility compliance

## Dependencies

### Already Available
- ✅ Backend search API deployed
- ✅ Frontend API client
- ✅ EpisodeCard component
- ✅ Authentication system
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling
- ✅ React Router navigation

### Need to Create
- [ ] Frontend search service
- [ ] Search state management
- [ ] Search results components
- [ ] Search filters UI
- [ ] Search analytics

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Performance**: Backend has caching implemented
- **Large Result Sets**: Pagination already implemented
- **Search Relevance**: Backend has multi-factor scoring
- **Mobile Performance**: Use React best practices

### User Experience Risks
- **Empty States**: Clear messaging for no results
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and spinners
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages
- **Search Feedback**: Clear indication of search progress

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Create basic search functionality
2. **Test Integration**: Ensure API calls work correctly
3. **Iterate on UI**: Improve search experience based on testing
4. **Add Advanced Features**: Search history, filters, analytics
5. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and infinite scroll

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Core): 30 minutes
