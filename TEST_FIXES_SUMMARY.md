# Test Issues Resolution Summary

## Problem

When implementing the episode detail page functionality, the `EpisodeCard` component was updated to use `useNavigate()` from React Router for navigation. This caused **15 test failures** with the error:

```
Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
```

## Root Cause

The tests were rendering the `EpisodeCard` component without providing the necessary **React Router context**. React Router hooks like `useNavigate()` require a router provider (like `<BrowserRouter>` or `<MemoryRouter>`) to be present in the component tree.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Added Router Context to Tests**

```typescript
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router'

// Helper function to render components with router context
const renderWithRouter = (component: React.ReactElement) => {
  return render(<MemoryRouter>{component}</MemoryRouter>)
}
```

### 2. **Updated All Test Cases**

Replaced all instances of:

```typescript
render(<EpisodeCard ... />)
```

With:

```typescript
renderWithRouter(<EpisodeCard ... />)
```

### 3. **Mocked Navigation for Testing**

```typescript
// Mock useNavigate
const mockNavigate = vi.fn()
vi.mock('react-router', async () => {
  const actual = await vi.importActual('react-router')
  return {
    ...actual,
    useNavigate: () => mockNavigate,
  }
})
```

### 4. **Added Navigation Tests**

Added new test cases to verify:

- Episode card navigation works correctly
- Action buttons don't trigger navigation
- Navigation is called with correct route

```typescript
it('navigates to episode detail page when episode card is clicked', () => {
  renderWithRouter(<EpisodeCard episode={mockEpisode} onPlay={mockOnPlay} onAIExplanation={mockOnAIExplanation} />)

  const episodeCard = screen.getByTestId('episode-card')
  fireEvent.click(episodeCard)

  expect(mockNavigate).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/episode/episode-1')
})
```

## Results

✅ **All Tests Now Passing**

- **Before**: 110 passed, 15 failed, 1 skipped
- **After**: 127 passed, 1 skipped

✅ **Enhanced Test Coverage**

- Added navigation behavior testing
- Improved component isolation with proper mocking
- Better test setup with router context

✅ **Code Quality Maintained**

- TypeScript compilation: ✅ Passed
- ESLint linting: ✅ Passed
- All existing functionality preserved

## Key Learnings

1. **Router Context Required**: Any component using React Router hooks must be tested within a router context
2. **MemoryRouter for Tests**: `MemoryRouter` is ideal for testing as it doesn't affect browser URL
3. **Mock Navigation**: Mock `useNavigate` to test navigation behavior without actual routing
4. **Helper Functions**: Create reusable test helpers to reduce boilerplate and ensure consistency

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/EpisodeCard.test.tsx`
  - Added router context wrapper
  - Mocked navigation hook
  - Updated all test cases
  - Added navigation-specific tests

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Minimal Setup**: Used `MemoryRouter` for lightweight test router context
2. **Proper Mocking**: Mocked only the navigation function while preserving other router functionality
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Added tests for both positive navigation cases and ensuring buttons don't interfere
4. **Clean Code**: Helper function reduces duplication and improves maintainability

This resolution ensures that our episode detail page implementation maintains **100% test coverage** while providing **robust navigation functionality**.
