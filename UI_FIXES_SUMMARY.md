# UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Podcast Title Wrapping

**Problem**: Podcast titles were truncated with ellipsis instead of wrapping to multiple lines.
**Solution**: Changed `truncate` class to `break-words` in `frontend/src/routes/library.tsx` (line 304).
**Impact**: Long podcast titles now properly wrap to multiple lines instead of being cut off.

### 2. ✅ Episode Title Wrapping

**Problem**: Episode titles were being truncated with `line-clamp-2` class.
**Solution**: Changed `line-clamp-2` to `leading-tight flex-1` in `frontend/src/components/EpisodeCard.tsx` (line 58).
**Impact**: Episode titles now properly wrap and display in full.

### 3. ✅ "0" on Episode Card Removed

**Problem**: Episode cards showed "0% complete" progress indicator even when no progress existed.
**Solution**: Removed hardcoded `playbackPosition: 0` from `transformEpisodeForCard` function in `frontend/src/routes/library.tsx` (line 161).
**Impact**: Progress indicators only show when there's actual playback progress, eliminating the confusing "0" display.

### 4. ✅ Play Button Functionality

**Problem**: Play button only logged to console instead of actually playing episodes.
**Solution**: Connected play button to MediaPlayerContext in `frontend/src/routes/library.tsx`:

- Added `useMediaPlayer` hook import
- Updated `handlePlayEpisode` function to use `playEpisode` from context
- Created proper episode object mapping with `MediaPlayerEpisode` type
  **Impact**: Play button now properly starts episode playback using the existing media player system.

### 5. ✅ Episode Thumbnails

**Problem**: Episode thumbnails were showing generic placeholder icons.
**Solution**: Updated episode thumbnail display in `frontend/src/components/EpisodeCard.tsx` to use episode images.
**Impact**: Episode thumbnails now show actual episode artwork when available, with fallback to placeholder icon.

## Additional Improvements (from git pull)

### 6. ✅ Progress Calculation Logic Fixed

**Problem**: Progress calculation had redundant computation `(playbackPosition! / 100) * 100`.
**Solution**: Simplified to direct usage `playbackPosition!` in EpisodeCard component.
**Impact**: More accurate and efficient progress display.

### 7. ✅ Comprehensive Test Coverage Added

**New**: Added complete test suite for EpisodeCard component covering:

- Basic rendering and information display
- Image handling (with and without thumbnails)
- Button click functionality (Play and AI explanation)
- Progress indicator logic (including edge cases)
- Date formatting
  **Impact**: Ensures UI components work correctly and prevents regressions.

### 8. ✅ Test Infrastructure Fixed

**Problem**: Test setup was missing proper jest-dom matchers and had component isolation issues.
**Solution**:

- Fixed `setupTests.ts` to properly import `@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest`
- Added proper test cleanup and isolation with `afterEach(cleanup)`
- Fixed button selection methods to use `getByLabelText` instead of `getByRole`
  **Impact**: All 24 tests now pass reliably.
