# UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Podcast Title Wrapping

**Problem**: Podcast titles were truncated with ellipsis instead of wrapping to multiple lines.
**Solution**: Changed `truncate` class to `break-words` in `frontend/src/routes/library.tsx` (line 304).
**Impact**: Long podcast titles now properly wrap to multiple lines instead of being cut off.

### 2. ✅ Episode Title Wrapping

**Problem**: Episode titles were being truncated with `line-clamp-2` class.
**Solution**: Changed `line-clamp-2` to `leading-tight flex-1` in `frontend/src/components/EpisodeCard.tsx` (line 58).
**Impact**: Episode titles now properly wrap and display in full.

### 3. ✅ "0" on Episode Card Removed

**Problem**: Episode cards showed "0% complete" progress indicator even when no progress existed.
**Solution**: Removed hardcoded `playbackPosition: 0` from `transformEpisodeForCard` function in `frontend/src/routes/library.tsx` (line 161).
**Impact**: Progress indicators only show when there's actual playback progress, eliminating the confusing "0" display.

### 4. ✅ Play Button Functionality

**Problem**: Play button only logged to console instead of actually playing episodes.
**Solution**: Connected play button to MediaPlayerContext in `frontend/src/routes/library.tsx`:

- Added `useMediaPlayer` hook import
- Updated `handlePlayEpisode` function to use `playEpisode` from context
- Created proper episode object mapping with `MediaPlayerEpisode` type
  **Impact**: Play button now properly starts episode playback using the existing media player system.

### 5. ✅ Episode Thumbnails

**Problem**: Episode thumbnails were showing generic placeholder icons.
**Solution**: Updated episode thumbnail display in `frontend/src/components/EpisodeCard.tsx` to use episode images.
**Impact**: Episode thumbnails now show actual episode artwork when available, with fallback to placeholder icon.
