# Episode Detail Page Fix Summary

## Issue

The episode detail page was showing "Unknown Podcast" and "Invalid Date" with no description because the backend API route expected by the frontend didn't exist.

## Root Cause

1. **Missing API Route**: The frontend was calling `/episodes/{podcastId}/{episodeId}` but this route was not configured in the API Gateway
2. **Incomplete Backend Handler**: The episode handler didn't have logic to handle requests with both `podcastId` and `episodeId`
3. **Inefficient Fallback**: Without the optimized route, the system fell back to searching through all user podcasts

## Changes Made

### 1. Infrastructure (CDK Stack)

**File**: `/workspace/infra/lib/rewind-backend-stack.ts`

- Added new API Gateway route: `GET /episodes/{podcastId}/{episodeId}`
- Maps to the episode Lambda function with Cognito authorization

### 2. Backend Handler

**File**: `/workspace/backend/src/handlers/episodeHandler.ts`

- Updated routing logic to handle both `podcastId` and `episodeId` parameters
- Added `getEpisodeByIdWithPodcast()` function for efficient episode retrieval
- Maintains backward compatibility with the inefficient `/episodes/{episodeId}` route

### 3. Frontend Updates

**Files Updated**:

- `/workspace/frontend/src/components/EpisodeCard.tsx` - Added `podcastId` to navigation
- `/workspace/frontend/src/routes/podcast-detail.tsx` - Pass `podcastId` in episode data
- `/workspace/frontend/src/routes/home.tsx` - Include `podcastId` from recommendations
- `/workspace/frontend/src/routes/episode-detail.tsx` - Use optimized API when available
- `/workspace/frontend/src/services/episodeService.ts` - Added `getEpisodeByIdWithPodcast()` method
- `/workspace/frontend/src/main.tsx` - Added route pattern for new URL structure

### 4. Tests

- Added 5 new tests for the episode handler covering the new route
- Added 2 new tests for the frontend episode service
- All 264 tests passing (129 frontend + 135 backend)

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Direct episode lookup is much faster than searching all podcasts
2. **Reliability**: Episode details now load correctly with proper data
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Old URLs still work with the fallback method

## Deployment Required

The infrastructure changes require a CDK deployment to create the new API route:

```bash
cd infra
npm run deploy
```

## Verification Steps

1. Navigate to any episode from the podcast detail page
2. Episode details should load with correct podcast name, date, and description
3. URL should be `/episode/{podcastId}/{episodeId}` for optimal performance
4. Old bookmarked URLs `/episode/{episodeId}` should still work
