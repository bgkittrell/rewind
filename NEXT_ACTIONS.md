# 🚀 Rewind: Immediate Next Actions

## 📍 Current Status
- ✅ **Frontend**: All UI components ready (EpisodeCard, FloatingMediaPlayer, etc.)
- ✅ **Backend**: Podcast management APIs working
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: AWS deployment pipeline working
- 🚧 **Gap**: Episode APIs missing (backend can't serve episodes to frontend)
- 🚧 **Gap**: Media player not connected to real audio data

## 🎯 Priority Focus: Episode Management & Playback

The most critical missing piece is **episode management**. We have a beautiful UI for episodes and media playback, but no backend APIs to serve episode data.

### 🔧 Immediate Actions (Next 3-5 Days)

#### 1. Fix Test Environment (30 minutes)
```bash
# Install missing test dependencies
npm install vitest @vitest/ui --workspace=frontend --save-dev
npm install vitest --workspace=backend --save-dev
npm install jest --workspace=infra --save-dev

# Verify tests work
npm run test
```

#### 2. Create Episode Backend APIs (Day 1-2)
**Priority**: Create `backend/src/handlers/episodeHandler.ts`

**Required endpoints**:
- `GET /episodes/{podcastId}` - Get episodes for a podcast
- `POST /episodes/{podcastId}/sync` - Parse RSS and store episodes
- `PUT /episodes/{episodeId}/progress` - Save playback position
- `GET /episodes/{episodeId}/progress` - Get playback position

**Database schema**: Episodes table with podcast relationship

#### 3. Connect Frontend to Episode APIs (Day 3)
**Priority**: Create `frontend/src/services/episodeService.ts`

**Integration points**:
- Library page: Load episodes when expanding a podcast
- EpisodeCard: Pass real episode data instead of mock data  
- FloatingMediaPlayer: Connect to real audio URLs
- Progress tracking: Sync with backend

#### 4. End-to-End Testing (Day 4-5)
- User can add a podcast (already works)
- Episodes appear in the library (new functionality)
- User can play an episode (new functionality)
- Playback position is saved/restored (new functionality)

### 🎛️ Technical Implementation Notes

#### Episode Handler Structure
```typescript
// GET /episodes/{podcastId}
{
  episodes: [
    {
      episodeId: string,
      title: string,
      description: string,
      audioUrl: string,
      duration: string,
      releaseDate: string,
      imageUrl?: string
    }
  ],
  pagination: { hasMore: boolean, nextCursor?: string }
}
```

#### Frontend Integration
```typescript
// In Library page
const episodes = await episodeService.getEpisodes(podcastId)

// In EpisodeCard
<EpisodeCard 
  episode={episode} 
  onPlay={(ep) => mediaPlayer.play(ep)}
  onAIExplanation={(ep) => showAIModal(ep)}
/>
```

### 📊 Success Criteria
- [ ] User adds a podcast → episodes automatically appear
- [ ] User clicks play → episode actually plays with audio
- [ ] User pauses/resumes → position is saved and restored
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

### ⚡ Quick Wins After Episode Management
Once episodes work, these become easy additions:
1. **Basic Recommendations**: Show "older episodes you haven't heard"
2. **Search**: Search within episodes, not just podcasts
3. **Progress Analytics**: "You've listened to 45 minutes this week"

## 🔄 Next Phase Preview

After episode management is working:
- **Week 2**: Simple recommendation algorithm
- **Week 3**: PWA features (offline, installable)  
- **Week 4**: Library sharing and advanced features

The foundation is solid - we just need to connect the beautiful frontend to episode data!
