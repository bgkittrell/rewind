# 🚀 Rewind: Immediate Next Actions

## 📍 Current Status

- ✅ **Frontend**: All UI components ready (EpisodeCard, FloatingMediaPlayer, etc.)
- ✅ **Backend**: Podcast management APIs working
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: AWS deployment pipeline working
- 🚧 **Gap**: Episode APIs missing (backend can't serve episodes to frontend)
- 🚧 **Gap**: Media player not connected to real audio data

## 🎯 Priority Focus: Episode Management & Playback

The most critical missing piece is **episode management**. We have a beautiful UI for episodes and media playback, but no backend APIs to serve episode data.

### 🔧 Immediate Actions (5-Day Sprint)

**📋 Detailed Implementation Guide**: See `docs/EPISODE_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md` for step-by-step tasks

#### Day 1: Backend Foundation

1. **RSS Episode Extraction** (2 hours)
   - Extend `rssService.ts` to parse individual episodes from RSS feeds
   - Add helper methods for audio URL, duration, images, guests
2. **DynamoDB Episode Operations** (3 hours)
   - Extend `dynamoService.ts` with episode CRUD operations
   - Add progress tracking methods for playback positions
   - Add batch operations for efficient episode storage

#### Day 2: API Handler & Infrastructure

3. **Episode API Handler** (4 hours)
   - Create `episodeHandler.ts` with full CRUD endpoints
   - Add progress tracking APIs for playback positions
   - Implement proper validation and error handling

4. **CDK Infrastructure Updates** (1 hour)
   - Add episode handler Lambda to CDK stack
   - Configure API Gateway routes and permissions
   - Deploy infrastructure changes

#### Day 3: Frontend Integration

5. **Episode Service** (2 hours)
   - Create `episodeService.ts` for API integration
   - Add TypeScript types and error handling

6. **Library Page Enhancement** (2 hours)
   - Add podcast expansion functionality
   - Load and display episodes with pagination
   - Connect EpisodeCard to real data

7. **MediaPlayer Integration** (1 hour)
   - Connect FloatingMediaPlayer to episode APIs
   - Add progress persistence and restoration

#### Day 4: Testing & Polish

8. **Automatic Episode Sync** (1 hour)
   - Episodes sync automatically when adding podcasts
   - Background processing for RSS feeds

9. **Comprehensive Testing** (3 hours)
   - Backend API tests (RSS, DynamoDB, handlers)
   - Frontend integration tests
   - Fix missing test dependencies

#### Day 5: End-to-End Validation

10. **User Flow Testing** (2 hours)
    - Complete podcast-to-playback workflow
    - Progress persistence across sessions
    - Error handling and edge cases

11. **Performance & Polish** (2 hours)
    - Loading states and error messages
    - Mobile optimization and responsive design
    - Final deployment and validation

### 🎛️ Technical Implementation Notes

#### Episode Handler Structure

```typescript
// GET /episodes/{podcastId}
{
  episodes: [
    {
      episodeId: string,
      title: string,
      description: string,
      audioUrl: string,
      duration: string,
      releaseDate: string,
      imageUrl?: string
    }
  ],
  pagination: { hasMore: boolean, nextCursor?: string }
}
```

#### Frontend Integration

```typescript
// In Library page
const episodes = await episodeService.getEpisodes(podcastId)

// In EpisodeCard
<EpisodeCard
  episode={episode}
  onPlay={(ep) => mediaPlayer.play(ep)}
  onAIExplanation={(ep) => showAIModal(ep)}
/>
```

### 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] User adds a podcast → episodes automatically appear
- [ ] User clicks play → episode actually plays with audio
- [ ] User pauses/resumes → position is saved and restored
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

### ⚡ Quick Wins After Episode Management

Once episodes work, these become easy additions:

1. **Basic Recommendations**: Show "older episodes you haven't heard"
2. **Search**: Search within episodes, not just podcasts
3. **Progress Analytics**: "You've listened to 45 minutes this week"

## 🔄 Next Phase Preview

After episode management is working:

- **Week 2**: Simple recommendation algorithm
- **Week 3**: PWA features (offline, installable)
- **Week 4**: Library sharing and advanced features

The foundation is solid - we just need to connect the beautiful frontend to episode data!

**Last Updated**: Next phase planning
**Focus**: Episode Management & Playback (Week 1 of Phase 3)
**Blocker**: Missing episode backend APIs
