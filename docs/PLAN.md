# Rewind Development Plan

## Overview

Rewind is a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed for podcast enthusiasts aged 35+ who enjoy rediscovering older episodes of their favorite podcasts, particularly comedy podcasts, when new content isn't available. The app prioritizes simplicity, ease of use, and a recommendation engine tailored to listening history and favorite guests. Built with AWS serverless resources and the AWS CDK for low-cost hosting and developer familiarity, Rewind allows users to manage and share their podcast libraries effortlessly.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Primary Goal**: Enable users to rediscover older episodes for an entertaining listening experience.
- **Target Audience**: Tech-savvy adults aged 35+ who subscribe to multiple podcasts, especially comedy podcasts.
- **Key Differentiator**: Focus on rediscovery of older episodes with a robust recommendation engine.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Router v7, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, PWA.
- **Backend**: Node.js Lambdas, TypeScript, DynamoDB, Cognito JWT, RESTful APIs.
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (S3, CloudFront, API Gateway, Lambda, Personalize), AWS CDK v2.
- **Testing**: Storybook (component testing), Vitest (unit/integration tests).
