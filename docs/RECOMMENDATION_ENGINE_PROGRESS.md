# Recommendation Engine Implementation Progress

## âœ… COMPLETED - Week 1: Database Schema Enhancement

### Database Schema Updates
- **Enhanced Episode table** with AI guest extraction fields:
  - `extractedGuests`: AI-extracted guest names
  - `guestExtractionStatus`: Processing status tracking
  - `guestExtractionDate`: When extraction was performed
  - `guestExtractionConfidence`: AI confidence score
  - `rawGuestData`: Raw AI response for debugging

- **Added new tables** for recommendation engine:
  - `UserFavorites`: Track user favorites and ratings
  - `GuestAnalytics`: User preference analytics for guests
  - `UserFeedback`: User feedback on episodes

- **Enhanced existing tables**:
  - Enabled DynamoDB Streams on Episodes table for real-time guest extraction
  - Added GSI indexes for efficient querying:
    - `LastPlayedIndex` on ListeningHistory
    - `UserSharesIndex` on Shares
    - `ItemTypeIndex` on UserFavorites

### TypeScript Types
- **Extended Episode interface** with guest extraction fields
- **Added recommendation types**:
  - `RecommendationScore`: Scored episode with explanation
  - `GuestExtractionRequest/Result`: AI extraction data structures
  - `RecommendationFilters`: User filtering options
  - `UserFavorites`, `GuestAnalytics`, `UserFeedback`: Database entities

## âœ… COMPLETED - AWS Bedrock Integration

### BedrockService Implementation
- **AI-powered guest extraction** using Claude 3 Haiku
- **Intelligent prompt engineering** for accurate guest identification
- **Robust error handling** with fallback responses
- **Batch processing** capabilities with rate limiting
- **Response parsing** and validation
- **Guest name normalization** for consistency

### Key Features
- **Conservative extraction**: Only extracts high-confidence guest names
- **Cost optimization**: Uses Haiku model for efficiency
- **Batch processing**: Handles up to 10 episodes simultaneously
- **Quality controls**: Limits to 5 guests per episode, proper name formatting

## âœ… COMPLETED - Recommendation Algorithm

### RecommendationService Implementation
- **Multi-factor scoring system** with configurable weights:
  - Recent Show Listening (25%): Episodes from recently listened shows
  - New Episode Bonus (25%): Unheard episodes with recency boost
  - Rediscovery Bonus (20%): Episodes not heard in 30+ days
  - Guest Match Bonus (20%): Episodes with previously enjoyed guests
  - Favorite Bonus (10%): Episodes from favorited shows/episodes

### Advanced Features
- **Intelligent scoring algorithms**:
  - Time-decay functions for recency calculations
  - Guest preference learning from listening history
  - Favorite show/episode boosting
  - Rediscovery sweet-spot targeting (3-12 months old)

- **Flexible filtering system**:
  - Filter by favorites only
  - Show only episodes with known guests
  - Exclude recent episodes
  - Show only new/unheard episodes

- **Explanation generation**: Human-readable reasons for each recommendation

## âœ… COMPLETED - API Endpoints

### Lambda Handlers
- **GET /recommendations**: Personalized episode recommendations
  - Query parameters for limit and filters
  - Returns scored episodes with explanations
  - Supports filtering by favorites, guests, recency, newness

- **POST /recommendations/extract-guests**: AI guest extraction
  - Single episode guest extraction
  - Returns extracted guests with confidence scores

- **POST /recommendations/batch-extract-guests**: Batch guest extraction
  - Process up to 10 episodes simultaneously
  - Efficient for bulk processing

- **POST /recommendations/guest-analytics**: Update guest preferences
  - Track user interactions with guest content
  - Update listening and favorite statistics

### Authentication & Validation
- **JWT authentication** via API Gateway authorizer
- **Input validation** for all endpoints
- **Error handling** with structured responses
- **Rate limiting** protection for AI services
