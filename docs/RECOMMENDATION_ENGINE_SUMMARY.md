# Recommendation Engine Planning Summary

## Overview

I've completed a comprehensive analysis of your recommendation engine requirements and created a detailed implementation plan. Here's what I found and planned:

## Your Requirements Analysis

### ✅ Core Ranking Factors (Exactly as Requested)

1. **Recent Show Listening**: Episodes from shows you've listened to recently
2. **New Episodes**: Episodes you haven't listened to yet
3. **Rediscovery**: Episodes you haven't heard in a while
4. **Guest Matching**: Episodes with guests from episodes you've liked
5. **Favorites**: Episodes you've marked as favorites

### ✅ Guest Extraction Strategy

- **AWS Bedrock Integration**: Using Claude 3 Haiku for cost-effective guest extraction
- **Intelligent Parsing**: AI prompts designed to extract guest names from episode titles and descriptions
- **Cost Estimate**: ~$0.005-$0.01 per episode (~$50-$100/month for 10,000 episodes)

## Implementation Plan Created

### 📋 5-Week Roadmap

**Week 1**: Database Schema Enhancement

- Add guest extraction fields to Episodes table
- Create GuestAnalytics table for user preferences
- Implement UserFavorites table

**Week 2**: AWS Bedrock Integration

- Set up Bedrock permissions in CDK
- Create guest extraction Lambda function
- Implement event-driven extraction pipeline

**Week 3**: Multi-Factor Recommendation Algorithm

- Implement 5-factor scoring system
- Weight factors: Guest matching (0.5), New episodes (0.4), Rediscovery (0.4), Recent shows (0.3), Favorites (0.3)
- Add recommendation caching for performance

**Week 4**: API Integration

- Update recommendation endpoints
- Add recommendation filters (not_recent, favorites, guests, new)
- Implement feedback collection system

**Week 5**: Frontend Integration

- Create recommendation display components
- Add filter controls for users
- Integrate with existing media player

## Key Technical Decisions

### 🎯 Database Design

- **Episodes Table**: Extended with AI-extracted guest data
- **GuestAnalytics Table**: Track user preferences per guest
- **UserFavorites Table**: Store user ratings and favorites

### 🤖 AI Integration

- **Model Choice**: Claude 3 Haiku (cost-effective, accurate)
- **Processing**: Event-driven via DynamoDB streams
- **Fallback**: Graceful handling of extraction failures

### 📊 Scoring Algorithm

Multi-factor scoring with explanations:

- Each factor contributes 0.0-0.5 points
- Total score capped at 1.0
- Human-readable explanations ("Features Joe Rogan, who you've enjoyed before")

## Files Created

1. **`docs/RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**: Comprehensive 5-week implementation plan
2. **Updated `docs/PLAN.md`**: Integrated recommendation engine into main project roadmap

## Next Steps

### 🚀 Ready to Start

1. **Phase 1**: Database schema enhancements (start here)
2. **AWS Bedrock Setup**: Configure IAM permissions and test API access
3. **Guest Extraction**: Build and test the AI extraction pipeline
4. **Recommendation Logic**: Implement the 5-factor scoring system
5. **Frontend Integration**: Create user-facing recommendation components

### 🔍 Considerations

- **Cost Monitoring**: Track Bedrock usage during development
- **Performance**: Implement caching for recommendation responses
- **User Testing**: Validate recommendation quality with real data
- **Feedback Loop**: Collect user feedback to improve recommendations

## Success Metrics Defined

### Technical

- Guest extraction accuracy > 85%
- API response time < 500ms
- Cache hit rate > 90%
- Cost per episode < $0.01

### User Engagement

- Recommendation click-through rate > 25%
- Episode completion rate > 60%
- User return rate > 40%
- Session time increase > 20%

## Questions for You

1. **Priority**: Should we start with the database schema enhancements this week?
2. **Guest Extraction**: Do you want to test the AI extraction with a sample of your actual podcast data?
3. **Budget**: Are you comfortable with the estimated $50-100/month cost for guest extraction?
4. **Timeline**: Does the 5-week timeline align with your expectations?

The plan is comprehensive and addresses all your requirements. We can start implementing immediately, beginning with the database schema enhancements to support the recommendation engine.
