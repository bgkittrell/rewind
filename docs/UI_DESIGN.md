# Rewind UI Design Specifications

## Overview
This document outlines the user interface design for Rewind, a mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) for podcast enthusiasts aged 35+ who enjoy rediscovering older episodes, particularly comedy podcasts. The UI follows a standard mobile app look with a fixed header, bottom action bar, and floating media player, prioritizing simplicity, thumb-friendly navigation, and accessibility for the target audience.

- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for smartphone screens (e.g., 375px–414px width).
- **Thumb-Friendly**: Large touch targets (minimum 48x48 pixels) for easy navigation.
- **Color Scheme**: Blue-green (teal) theme, hex codes TBD by design team (e.g., #26A69A as placeholder).
- **Typography**: High-contrast, WCAG 2.1 compliant (4.5:1 contrast ratio), using system fonts (e.g., Roboto or SF Pro) for consistency.
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support, ARIA labels for interactive elements, clear focus states.
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens for perceived performance during data fetching.
