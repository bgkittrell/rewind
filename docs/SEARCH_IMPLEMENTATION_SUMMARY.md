# Search Backend Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

We successfully implemented a serverless search backend for the Rewind podcast app that allows users to quickly search through episodes in their library. The solution is optimized for low cost at low scale while maintaining good performance.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Search Type Definitions (`backend/src/types/search.ts`)

- Defined interfaces for search queries, results, and configuration
- Set up field weights for relevance scoring (title: 3.0, guests: 2.0, description: 1.0)
- Configuration constants for search behavior

### 2. Search Utilities (`backend/src/utils/searchUtils.ts`)

- Query normalization and tokenization
- Multi-field scoring algorithm with word boundary detection
- Search term highlighting for UI display
- Recency bonus calculation for newer episodes
- Comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage

### 3. Search Service (`backend/src/services/searchService.ts`)

- Main search logic with episode filtering and ranking
- In-memory caching with 5-minute TTL for performance
- Parallel data fetching from DynamoDB
- Pagination support
- Clean data formatting for API responses

### 4. Search Handler (`backend/src/handlers/searchHandler.ts`)

- Lambda function for handling search API requests
- Input validation and error handling
- Query parameter parsing
- JWT authentication integration
- Comprehensive test coverage

### 5. Infrastructure Updates (`infra/lib/rewind-backend-stack.ts`)

- Added SearchHandler Lambda function with 512MB memory
- ARM64 architecture for cost optimization
- 10-second timeout for search operations
- API Gateway route: `GET /search`
- DynamoDB read permissions for podcasts and episodes tables

### 6. API Documentation

- Updated `docs/BACKEND_API.md` with search endpoint specification
- Comprehensive implementation plan in `docs/SEARCH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Search Features

- **Multi-field search**: Searches across episode titles, descriptions, guest names, and tags
- **Relevance scoring**: Weighted scoring system prioritizing title matches
- **Search highlighting**: Returns highlighted snippets for UI display
- **Pagination**: Support for limit/offset based pagination
- **Podcast filtering**: Option to search within a specific podcast
- **Performance optimization**: Caching and parallel queries for fast response times

## Performance Characteristics

- **Target response time**: <1 second for typical libraries
- **Cache TTL**: 5 minutes for episode and podcast data
- **Memory usage**: 512MB Lambda (balanced for performance/cost)
- **Concurrency**: Parallel DynamoDB queries for multiple podcasts

## Cost Analysis

At low scale (100 users, 50 episodes each):

- **Lambda**: ~$0.50/month
- **API Gateway**: ~$3.50/month
- **Total additional cost**: ~$4.50/month

## Testing

- All components have comprehensive unit tests
- 161 total tests passing
- Search utilities tested for edge cases
- Handler tested for various error scenarios
- Linting and TypeScript compilation successful

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Deploy the updated CDK stack:

   ```bash
   cd infra
   npm run cdk deploy RewindBackendStack
   ```

2. Verify the search endpoint is accessible:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://[api-url]/search?q=test" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer [jwt-token]"
   ```

3. Update frontend to integrate with the search API

## Future Enhancements

When scale justifies (>1000 episodes per user):

- Integrate AWS OpenSearch for full-text search
- Add fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
- Implement search suggestions/autocomplete
- Add advanced filters (date range, duration)
- Track search analytics for insights

## Conclusion

The search backend is fully implemented, tested, and ready for deployment. It provides a cost-effective solution for episode search that scales with your user base while maintaining good performance at low scale.
