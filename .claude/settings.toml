# Custom review instructions
instructions = """
When reviewing code, please focus on:

1. **Security**: Check for potential vulnerabilities, API key exposure, input validation
2. **Performance**: Identify inefficient operations, unnecessary re-renders, bundle size impacts
3. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
4. **TypeScript**: Verify proper typing, avoid 'any' usage, use discriminated unions where appropriate
5. **React Best Practices**: Proper hook usage, component composition, state management
6. **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design, touch targets, performance on mobile devices
7. **Error Handling**: Proper try-catch blocks, user-friendly error messages, fallback UI
8. **Code Quality**: DRY principles, readable variable names, appropriate comments

Please be constructive and specific in your feedback, providing examples or suggestions where possible.
